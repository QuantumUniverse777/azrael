    summary: >
      AssImp library and Python3 bindings. Note that this is not the original AssImp
      repository (https://github.com/assimp/assimp) but a fork thereof
      that contains the Conda recipes (https://github.com/olitheolix/assimp.git)
      as well. In terms of functionality there is no difference.
