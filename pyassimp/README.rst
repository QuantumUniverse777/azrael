This directory contains the Python bindings for `AssImp
<http://assimp.sourceforge.net/index.html>`_. These are bundled with Azrael for
convenience only but have a different license (BSD variant). The original
files, including the license for them, are `here
<https://github.com/assimp/assimp/tree/master/port/PyAssimp>`_.
